# Advanced_Control_System_MSD
This project explores the modeling, analysis, and optimal control of a mass-spring-damper (MSD) system using the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) method. The MSD system is a fundamental second-order mechanical model widely used in engineering to study vibrations and dynamic responses.
